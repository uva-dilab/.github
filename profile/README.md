The DILAB is a Human-Computer Interaction research group within the Informatics Institute at the University of Amsterdam. 

Our research bridges the gap between the technology-oriented and market-led formulation of the smart agenda with a sociological and 
psychological understanding of what people need artificial intelligence to be, and how data science might enhance our societies.
